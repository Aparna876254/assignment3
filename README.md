This repository contains two Python tasks.


## ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function (`fact.py`)

**Problem Statement:**  
Write a Python program that:

2. Returns the calculated factorial.  
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.


## ðŸ“Œ Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations (`module.py`)

**Problem Statement:**  
Write a Python program that:
1. Asks the user for a number as input.  
2. Uses the `math` module to calculate:  
   - Square root of the number
